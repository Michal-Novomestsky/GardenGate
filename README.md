### What's done:
* Offsets
* Hosting servers
* Joining
* Custom unlocker mod that unlocks everything

### What's not done (TODO):
* BFN support (launcher and server side)
* Make launcher rename `EAAntiCheat.GameServiceLauncher.exe` & `installScript.vdf`
* Custom color for launcher buttons
* Player kicking/moderation
* Make launch args real time bc EA App sucks (gw1)
* Fix return to backyard button (gw2)
* Fix Zombopolis last, several doorways in the center area are blocked for clients. Host and bots can pass through, but clients and their objects (e.g. bean bombs) cannot.
