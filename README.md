Experimental private servers for Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 1 & 2

------
### What's done:
* Offsets
* Hosting servers
* Joining
* Custom unlocker mod that unlocks everything

### What's not done (TODO):
* BFN support (launcher and server side)
* Make launcher rename `EAAntiCheat.GameServiceLauncher.exe` & `installScript.vdf`
* Custom color for launcher buttons
* Player kicking/moderation
* [Closing a client](./Assets/client.webp) through the console instead of the game tricks the server into believing you are still connected, so attempting to load into another level causes the entire server to softlock
* Make it so that only host can load into the backyard
* Fix Zombopolis last, several doorways in the center area are blocked for clients. Host and bots can pass through, but clients and their objects (e.g. bean bombs) cannot.
* Fix Zomburbia Zombot fuses on last point unable to be broken
