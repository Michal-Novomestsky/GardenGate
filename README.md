Experimental private servers for Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 1,2 & Battle for Neighborville

------
### What's done:
* Offsets
* Hosting servers
* Joining
* Custom unlocker mod that unlocks everything

### What's not done (TODO):
* Player kicking/moderation
* Bot support for gw1
* Bfn [splitscreen fix without frosty](https://github.com/nocss42/GardenGate/pull/9)
* Bfn unlockall
* Make it so that only host can load into levels
* [Closing a client](./Assets/client.webp) through the console instead of the game tricks the server into believing you are still connected, so attempting to load into another level causes the entire server to softlock
* Fix Zombopolis last, several doorways in the center area are blocked for clients. Host and bots can pass through, but clients and their objects (e.g. bean bombs) cannot.
* Fix Zomburbia Zombot fuses on last point unable to be broken
