### Running GardenGate on Linux

### Keep in mind that this is currently experimental.

# Garden warfare 1
### 1. Install the game
* Install the game from ea app, launch it once

### 2. Download and place files to your game's root directory
Download the archive from [the releases](https://github.com/nocss42/GardenGate/releases) tab, launch it > go to patcher and press apply patch

### 3. Install the mods
Use [this gw1 compatible frosty mod manager](https://github.com/Twig6943/FrostyToolsuiteGW1Linux/releases) instead of the stock one as the stock one doesn't work with wine nor gw1. Get the mods from [here](../Mods/GW1)

### 4. Configure data dir env var & dlloverrides
Use `GAME_DATA_DIR` environment variable as ea app won't allow special characters like `/` as launch args

```
GAME_DATA_DIR="path/to/ModData/Default" WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b;winmm=n,b" %command%
```

Open up winetricks > select gw1's pfx > select winecfg > go to libraries > add the following

```
dinput8
winmm
```

* Apply 
- Launch via the launcher

# Garden warfare 2/Battle for Neighborville
### 1. Install the game

### 2. Downgrade your game
Download the archive from [the releases](https://github.com/nocss42/GardenGate/releases) tab, launch it > go to patcher and press apply patch

### 3. Install the mods in the right order
Use [this frosty mod manager](https://github.com/maniman303/FrostyToolsuite/releases) instead of the stock one as the stock one doesn't work with wine. Get the mods for gw2 [here](../Mods/GW2/GardenGate.fbpack)

### 4. Configure dlloverrides
Add the following launch option in Steam:
```
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b;winmm=n,b" %command% -dataPath ModData/Default
```

Open up protontricks > select gw2 > select winecfg > go to libraries > add the following

```
dinput8
winmm
```

(They should be set to native,builtin)

### 5. Launch the game
- Launch via the launcher if you own the game on EA App. If you own the game on steam just pass in the launch args yourself;

### Arguements

`-dataPath`
