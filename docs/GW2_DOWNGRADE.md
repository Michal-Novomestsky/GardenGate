# Downgrading Garden Warfare 2's executable

1. Download [xdelta patcher](https://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher/releases) & the [xdelta patch for pre EA AC](https://github.com/nocss42/GardenGate/raw/refs/heads/main/Launcher/GW2_NO_EAAC.xdelta)

2. Open xdelta patcher, select your game's executable as the original file and select the xdelta patch

It should look something like this;

3. Press `Apply patch`

### We'll probably automate this with the launcher at some point.
